\chapter{Introduction}

The idea that, during their evolution, galaxies go through many dynamical processes with structures of comparable size, is now commonly accepted. Their history is divided by short periods of collision followed by longer periods of stabilization. The Milky Way (MW hereinafter), the galaxy that planet Earth inhabits, is the most detailed picture of a galaxy we can have access to. Because of this, it has been the prototypical spiral galaxy, but recent evidence suggests that for multiple reasons  \cite{Cautun_2018}, it's atypical.

OJO REVISAR REESTRUCTURAR

The conscious and constant effort, made by the history of astronomers that precede this attempt to collaborate in humanity's understanding of the universe, have made our models of the galaxies get more precise and sophisticated as time goes on. The technical development occurring thanks to engineering, quantum theories and other physics areas, allow a very fast-paced increase in our computational power and observational capabilities in astronomy.
